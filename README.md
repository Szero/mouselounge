Play videos in your tribehouse while running the client outisde of the browser
(using steam client for example)

Playing videos in music rooms is WIP.

This works only on linux atm.

## Requirements

Install those programs with your package manager or download them from the developers
directly:

Please use recent version of `python3`.

- [mpv](https://mpv.io/installation/)
- [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl)
- [tcpflow](https://github.com/simsong/tcpflow)

For my repo, just clone it if you know what `git` is or download the zip.

## Running

Extract the zip if you didn't use `git` and than go into the `mouseloungue` 
direcotry and run `__main__.py` as such:

    ./__main__.py

Thats it!
